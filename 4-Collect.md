4.1 SELECT SAMPLE

The production sample is selected. Any issues with the sampling processes need to be thoroughly documented.

4.2 SET UP COLLECTION

Software and staff are ready, pretest data are cleared out, final access to subjects and settings is arranged, notifications to subjects are sent out, appointments are made, and so on.

4.3 RUN COLLECTION

Data begin coming in. Data security and backup procedures are in place. Metadata and paradata generated during collection are preserved.

4.4 FINALIZE COLLECTION

This step may involve notifications or payments to subjects, rescheduling, debriefings of collection staff, closing down facilities, or making arrangements for future collection phases.
