GLBPM
=====

The intention of the **Generic Longitudinal Business Process Model** (GLBPM) is to provide a generic model that can serve as the basis for informing discussions across organizations conducting longitudinal data collections, and other data collections repeated across time. The model is not intended to drive implementation directly. Rather, it is primarily intended to serve as a reference model against which implemented processes are mapped, for the purposes of determining where they may be similar to or different from other processes in other organizations. It may also prove useful to those designing new longitudinal studies, providing reminders of steps which may need to be planned.
